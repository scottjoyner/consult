  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p class="muted small">Effective 30 September 2024</p>
  <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the services provided by Campbell Cognition Consultants LLC (“Campbell Cognition,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By booking a consultation, purchasing a retainer, or collaborating with us on an engagement, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Services</h2>
    <p>We provide architecture advisory, AI integration support, automation design, and related consulting services as described on our website, proposals, and statements of work (SOWs). Specific deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities will be defined in the SOW or engagement letter for each project.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Booking and Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Introductory consultations are prepaid through our secure checkout and are non-refundable once delivered.</li>
      <li>Retainer engagements renew monthly unless canceled according to the notice period in your SOW.</li>
      <li>Invoices for project work are due upon receipt unless otherwise stated. Late payments may incur interest at the maximum rate permitted by law.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to suspend services for accounts that are past due.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate information, timely access, and necessary approvals so we can perform the services.</li>
      <li>Ensure that any materials you provide do not infringe third-party rights and comply with applicable laws.</li>
      <li>Maintain appropriate security controls for your systems, credentials, and data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>We treat your confidential information with care and use it solely to deliver the services. Each party agrees to protect the other party’s confidential information with at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own, and not to disclose it to any third party without prior written consent except as required by law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified in your SOW, you own the deliverables we create specifically for you once payment is complete. We retain ownership of our pre-existing materials, methodologies, templates, and know-how, but grant you a non-exclusive license to use them as part of the deliverables.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Compliance &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>We design engagements to respect your compliance obligations (including SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and other regulatory regimes). You are responsible for informing us of any additional requirements before an engagement begins. We do not guarantee regulatory approval, but we provide documentation and design decisions to support your review processes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Warranties &amp; Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>We warrant that we will perform the services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. Except as expressly stated in these Terms, we disclaim all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee specific business results or outcomes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the services is limited to the amounts you paid to us for the services giving rise to the claim within the 12 months preceding the event. We are not liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, or special damages.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate an engagement for material breach that remains uncured after 14 days’ written notice. Upon termination you agree to pay for all services rendered through the effective termination date. Sections relating to confidentiality, intellectual property, payment obligations, and limitations of liability survive termination.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Fairfax County, Virginia, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction there.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and post the revised Terms on this page. Continued use of our services after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
