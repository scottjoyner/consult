  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p class="muted small">Effective 1 October 2024</p>

  <section class="notice">
    <h2>How to use these Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (the “Terms”) are the master agreement between Campbell Cognition Consultants LLC (“Campbell Cognition,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and the client entity that books, signs, or pays for our services (“Client,” “you,” or “your”). They work together with any proposal, statement of work (SOW), or retainer order form (each an “Engagement Document”).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order of precedence:</strong> Engagement Documents &gt; these Terms &gt; any ancillary policies referenced herein.</li>
      <li><strong>Document stack:</strong> Terms, <a href="/site/legal/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="/site/legal/cookies.html">Cookie Notice</a>, and any signed Engagement Document or retainer plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> You provide timely information and approvals, we deliver scoped services with professional care, and both parties safeguard confidential data and comply with law.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small muted">By booking a clarity call, signing a proposal, paying an invoice, or otherwise accepting an Engagement Document, you agree to these Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Engagement Workflow &amp; Formation</h2>
    <p>Our standard workflow consists of (a) booking a paid introductory consultation, (b) receiving a written proposal with scope, deliverables, fees, and assumptions, and (c) confirming an Engagement Document (proposal acceptance, SOW, or retainer order form). The agreement between the parties is formed when you accept an Engagement Document, pay an invoice, or provide written authorization to proceed.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Services</h2>
    <p>We provide architecture advisory, AI integration support, workflow automation design, and related consulting services. Specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and timelines are defined in the applicable Engagement Document. We may recommend third-party services or vendors but do not warrant their offerings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Retainers &amp; Time Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Retainer plans provide a monthly allocation of advisory hours, workshops, and deliverables described in the order form.</li>
      <li>Unused hours expire at the end of each retainer month unless otherwise specified. We may, at our discretion, roll over up to 25% of unused time.</li>
      <li>Time is tracked in 30-minute increments and reported via the client portal or periodic summaries.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Fees, Expenses &amp; Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fees are set out in the Engagement Document. All amounts are quoted in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Invoices are due upon receipt and payable within 15 calendar days via ACH transfer, credit card, or other agreed method. Late payments accrue interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate if lower).</li>
      <li>You are responsible for reasonable, pre-approved travel or third-party expenses incurred on your behalf. We will provide supporting documentation upon request.</li>
      <li>We may suspend services for accounts that are more than 15 days past due after written notice.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Change Management</h2>
    <p>Material changes to scope, timeline, or assumptions require a written change order or updated Engagement Document. We will notify you if requested work exceeds the agreed scope and provide options before proceeding.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide timely access to stakeholders, systems, documentation, and subject-matter experts.</li>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Each party may disclose confidential information to the other during the engagement. The receiving party will protect the disclosing party’s confidential information with at least the same degree of care it uses for its own (and no less than reasonable care), use it solely to perform obligations under the engagement, and not disclose it to third parties except to permitted subcontractors or advisors bound by similar obligations. These obligations continue for five (5) years after disclosure, or indefinitely for trade secrets.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Data Protection &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>We handle personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws. Where required, the parties will execute data processing addenda or business associate agreements. Each party will promptly notify the other of any confirmed unauthorized access to the other party’s confidential information and cooperate in remediation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You retain ownership of your pre-existing materials and data. We retain ownership of our pre-existing tools, frameworks, and know-how.</li>
      <li>Upon full payment of fees, you receive a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and modify the deliverables created specifically for you during the engagement for your internal business purposes.</li>
      <li>We may reuse generalized knowledge, ideas, or non-confidential learnings developed while providing services.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Publicity &amp; Portfolio Use</h2>
    <p>We may list your company name and logo as a client in marketing materials only with your prior written consent. Testimonials or case studies require separate approval.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Compliance</h2>
    <p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to align our work with your regulatory obligations (including SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, or other regimes identified in the Engagement Document). You are responsible for informing us of any mandatory requirements and for your own compliance determinations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. Warranties</h2>
    <p>We warrant that we will perform the services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with industry standards. We further warrant that we have the right to grant the licenses described in these Terms. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, each party’s total liability arising out of or relating to an engagement is limited to the fees paid or payable by you for the services giving rise to the claim in the twelve (12) months preceding the event. Neither party is liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or special damages, including lost profits, revenue, or data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>Each party will indemnify and defend the other against third-party claims to the extent arising from the indemnifying party’s (a) gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) violation of law, or (c) infringement of intellectual property rights by materials the indemnifying party provides. The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of claims, allow control of the defense, and cooperate at the indemnifying party’s expense.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>15. Term &amp; Termination</h2>
    <p>These Terms remain in effect for as long as any Engagement Document is active. Either party may terminate an engagement for material breach that remains uncured 14 days after written notice. Either party may terminate a retainer by providing 30 days’ written notice after the initial commitment period specified in the order form. Upon termination, you will pay for services performed and approved expenses incurred through the effective termination date.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>16. Effect of Termination</h2>
    <p>Upon termination, each party will return or destroy the other’s confidential information, subject to archival copies required by law. Sections relating to payment, confidentiality, data protection, intellectual property, limitations of liability, indemnification, and governing law survive termination.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>17. Independent Contractor &amp; Subcontractors</h2>
    <p>We are an independent contractor. Nothing creates a partnership, joint venture, fiduciary, or employment relationship. We may use vetted subcontractors or affiliates to deliver portions of the services; we remain responsible for their performance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>18. Non-Solicitation</h2>
    <p>During the engagement and for six (6) months after its conclusion, neither party will solicit for employment any personnel of the other directly involved in providing or receiving the services, except through general solicitations not specifically targeting such personnel.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>19. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Neither party is liable for failure to perform due to events beyond its reasonable control, including natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions, or widespread service outages, provided that the affected party gives prompt notice and resumes performance as soon as practicable.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>20. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to conflict of law principles. The parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Fairfax County, Virginia. The parties agree to attempt good-faith negotiation for at least 15 days before initiating litigation.</p>
  </section>

    <p>Formal notices must be sent by email to <a href="mailto:legal@campbellcognition.com">legal@campbellcognition.com</a> with a copy to hello@campbellcognition.com, and to the contact email or address you designate in the Engagement Document.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>22. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force. Neither party may assign the engagement without the other’s written consent, except that either party may assign to an affiliate or successor in interest in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all assets. These Terms, together with the Engagement Documents and referenced policies, are the entire agreement between the parties regarding the services.</p>
